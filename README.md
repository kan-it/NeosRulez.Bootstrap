# NeosRulez Bootstrap Package

A basic package to start building awesome Neos CMS websites based on Bootstrap v4 

## Installation

NeosRulez.Bootstrap is listed on packagist now (https://packagist.org/packages/patriceckhart/neosrulez-bootstrap) - therefore you don't have to include the package in your "repositories" entry any more.

Just add the following line to your require section:

```
"neosrulez/bootstrap": "1.*"
```

And the run this command to fetch the plugin:

```
composer update
```

## Including Bootstrap

NeosRulez Bootstrap Package does not use the Neos.Twitter.Bootstrap package at the moment. It is based on Bootstrap v4 and has all needed files on board.
